Visualizing Climate Change Data with Plotly

In this project, I present three Plotly-created visuals that summarize why the countries most vulnerable to climate change find it challenging to adapt to climate change impacts. The code for creating the visuals is in the "CC_Viz_Code" file while the data plotted is in the "full_data.csv" file.
