Visualizing Climate Change Data with Plotly

It is common knowledge that the poorest countries face the greatest risks from climate change and require international support to finance adaptation. What is less common is knowledge of the degree of countries' vulnerability to and preparedness for climate change risks. In this project, I create an interactive and informative Plotly visual that provides rich insights on this issue. The code for creating the visuals is in the "CC_Viz_Code" file while the data plotted is in the "full_data.csv" file. An article about this plot is available at: https://sites.google.com/view/rbbello/data-portfolio/dataviz/climateadapt
